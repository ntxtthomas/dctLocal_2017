== Description ==
This plugin, working with the [Schema App Tools](https://www.schemaapp.com) makes doing schema markup easy. 

By default, the Schema App Plugin optimizes all your pages, posts, author pages and more using information that already exists on your Wordpress website.  All you have to do is 1 minute of setup and then the optimization is done for you. 

The plugin also provides all three Google Site Structure features including [Breadcrumbs](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/breadcrumbs), [Sitelinks Searchbox](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/sitelinks-searchbox) and [Your Site Name in Results](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/sitename).

Want to optimize your entire site? The [Schema App JSON-LD Markup Generator](https://www.schemaapp.com/schema-org-json-ld-markup-editor/) allows you to add additional Schema markup to your Wordpress site without having to be a structured data expert. Now you can optimize your homepage with your business information, your about page with information about the people at your company, services you sell, events, job postings, etc. If there is something strategic on your site you want Google to know about, you can optimize it with Schema App JSON-LD Markup Generator. 

Schema App JSON-LD Markup Generator has the entire Schema.org vocabulary and automates validation of inputs, and creation/deployment of schema.org code. You don't need a developer to use our tools and you can update your markup anytime without having to do re-work.

<strong>Free Accounts</strong> can create and customize up to 50 data items for 10 webpages. When combined with the highest quality Article and BlogPosting Schema markup in Wordpress users get great value for free.
